Our program has been designed in order to educate people who use it about the solar system and even astronomy in general.
Although it might not have everything to know about astronomy, it may spark an interest of astronomy to those who knew nothing 
about it. We hope people who use this program leave with a little more knowledge about their solar system if they didn't know anything 
already. This program isn't just designed to be educational, but fun as well. How do you use this program? Well first you must run the 
program itself my pressing "run". After this, you will see a window open up with a title screen. In order to continue you must press 
any key on your keyboard. This will bring you to the main menu where you can see 6 options: instructions, lesson, game, quiz, results,
